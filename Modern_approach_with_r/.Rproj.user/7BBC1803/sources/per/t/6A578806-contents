## Normal distribution

no distribuition is exactly normal

used in data exploration

DEFINITION:

describes a symmetric unimodal bell shaped curve

adjusted w/ 
mean() - right left shift
sd()  - constrict or open curve

(CENteR AND SPREAD)

written as

N(mu=mean, rho=sd())

## Standardizing with Z scores

Z score:
-a standardatization technique between data 
-how many sd() your data point is away from the mean

Z=(data_point-mean)/sd()

## Finding tail areas

pnorm()
-takes in z score and gives the lower tail area

```{r}
pnorm(0)
pnorm(1)
pnorm(1300, mean=1100, sd=200)
```



## Normal probability Examples


SAT Normal distribution
N(1000, 200)

what is p( SAT>1190?)

```{r}
1-pnorm(1190,mean=1100,sd=200)
1-pnorm(1190,1100,200)

or get zscore first

Z-(data-mean)/sd =.45

1-pnorm(.45)




```

Draw a picture first then find z score to confirm area of interest

FINDING AREAS TO THE RIGHT:
1- pnorm()

1-pnorm(1500,1100,200)

Excersizes

mike is 40th percentile height, how tall is he
```{r}
#percentile to z score

((qnorm(.4)*3.3)+70)/12

12*.763
# height is 5'9"

#adult male in 82nd %

zscore<-qnorm(.82)
h_feet<-((zscore*3.3)+70)/12
inches<-(h_feet%%1)*12
h_feet
feet<-h_feet-(inches*.1)%>%round(0)
feet<-round(feet,0)
feet
inches
height<-c("feet"=feet,"inches"=inches)
height

```



## 68-95-99.7 rule

.68 falling between -1 and 1 sd
.95 falling between -2 and 2 sd
.997 falling between -3 and 3 sd

Exercises

```{r}

#area under a curver
less than
z=-1.35
pnorm(z)

more than 
z=1.48
1-pnorm(z)

between -.4 and 1.5
zl=-.4
zr=1.5
pnorm(1.5)-pnorm(-.4)

abs(z) greater than 2

z=2
a<-2*(1-pnorm(z))
a



```



#Geometric Distribution

### Bernoulli Distribution


Bernoulli Random Variable

When a trial only has the probability of success or failure 

-success and failure is a thing you denote, like above .70 percent chance of happening = success

or you could say above .7 = failure and .3= success

phat=#of successes/ # of trials= probability of success

can describe mean and sd of bernoulli random variable

Bernoulli Random Variable
DEFINITION:

if X is a random variable that takes value 1 with probability of success p and 0 with probability (1-p) then X is a Bernoulli random variable with mean and sd

mean=p
sd=sqrt(p(1-p))

mean and expected value both use mu. 
THEY ARE THE SAME

it takes on average 1/p trials to get a success under the geometric distribution
EXAMPLE:

```{r}
#probability of success on one trial =p
#high P
p<-.8
1/p

#low p
p<-.1
print(1/p)



#probability to find success in first 3 cases

#p(n=1,2, or 3)
#P(n=1)+p(n=2)+p(n=3)
#(1 − p)^n−1*p

a<-.3^0*.7
b<-.3^1*.7
c<-.3^2*.7
a+b+c


```


## Binomial Distribution

Binomial distribution is used to describe the number of successes in a fixed number of trials


Describes the probability of having exactly "k" successes in "n" independent bernoulli trials with probability of a succcess "p"

read: "n choose k"
factorial()


DEFINITION:
Binomial Distribution


Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is p. Then the probability of observing
exactly k successes in n independent trials is given by

(n) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)*p^k*(1-p)^(n-k)
(k)

mean=np
sd()=sqrt(np(1-p))

IS IT BINOMIAL? FOUR CHECK CONDITIONS
1. The trials are independent
2. The number of trials, n, is fixed
3. Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure
4. The probability of a succcess p, is the same for each trial


## Computing Binomial Probabilities

The first step in using the binomial model is to check that the model is appropriate.  The second step is to identify "n, p and k" 
As the last stage use software or the formulas to determine the probability, then interpret the results


(n) =  n!/(k!(n-k)!)*p^k(1-p)^(n-k)
(k)

## Normal approximation to the binomial distribution

binomial formula is bad when (n) is large

use normal distribution as an easier and faster way to estimate binomial probabilities



### Normal Approximation of the binomial distribution

the binomial distribution with probability of success "p" is nearly normal when the sample size is sufficiently large that np and n(1-p) are both at least 10. the approximate normal distribution has parameters correspondind to the mean and sd() of the binomial distribution.

mean=np 
sd()=sqrt(np(1-p))


we can get mu and sd() from the previous equations

GET Z score x=number you are interested in
mu and sd()

Z=x-mu)/sd

```{r}
x<-42
n<-400
p<-.15
mean<-n*p
mean

sd<-sqrt(n*p*(1-p))
sd

zscore<-(x-mean)/sd
zscore
bu<-scale(x,mean,sd) #produces z score
bu[1] # just the z score


#probability of observing x or fewer cases
pnorm(bu[1])

```


## Normal approx breaks down on small intervals

normal approx to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts, even when the conditions are met

EX:
prob of 49 50 or 51 smokers in 400 with p=15

doesnt work


IMPROVING THE NORMAL APPRX FOR THE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION

the normal approximation to the binomial distribution for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff values are modified slightly.

the cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region should be REDUCED by .5 and the upper cutoff should be INCREASED by .5
