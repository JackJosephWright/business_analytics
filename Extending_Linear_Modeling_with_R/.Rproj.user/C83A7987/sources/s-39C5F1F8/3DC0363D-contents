```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
data(danishlc, package='GLMsData')

#make a rate column

danishlc$Rate<-danishlc$Cases/danishlc$Pop*1000
#make ages factors
#have to manually change the order
danishlc$Age<-ordered(danishlc$Age, levels=c("40-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69", "70-74",">74"))

#abbreviate the city names

danishlc$City<-abbreviate(
  names.arg=danishlc$City,
  minlength = 1
)

xtabs(
    formula=Rate~Age+City, data=danishlc
  )
```


```{r}
ggplot(danishlc,aes(x=Age,y=Rate, group=City,color=City))+geom_smooth()
```
looks like city factor might be multiplicative

```{r}
options(
  contrasts = c('contr.treatment','contr.treatment')
)

list_glm<-list()

list_glm[['City_Age']]<-glm(
  formula=Cases~offset(log(Pop))+City*Age,
  family = poisson,
  data=danishlc
)
list_glm[['Age']]<-glm(
  formula = Cases~offset(log(Pop))+Age,
  family = poisson,
  data=danishlc
)
#instead of making a new vector for every level of age, just make a vector with each age value
danishlc$Age_Numeric<-rep(
  x=c(40,55,60,65,70,75),
  times=4
)
list_glm[['Age_Numeric']]<-glm(
  formula=Cases~offset(log(Pop))+Age_Numeric,
  family=poisson,
  data=danishlc
)

#if you look at the downward movement on interaction graph, it could be a quadratic interaction, which is why we use a degree 2 polynomial on age
#poly(Age_Numeric,2) is the same as age+age^2 (a quadratic) except they are orthogonal
list_glm[["Age_Numeric_2"]]<-glm(
  formula=Cases~offset(log(Pop))+poly(Age_Numeric,2),
  family=poisson,
  data=danishlc
)
```

```{r}
lapply(
  X=list_glm,
  #anova with test=Chisq will analyze deviance instead of sum of squares
  FUN = function(x) anova(
    object =x,
    test='Chisq'
  )
)
```

I want to be able to look at all 4 models to compare


USE AIC

how much info is lost from data, low is good

```{r}
lapply(
  X=list_glm,
  FUN = AIC
)
```



Goodness-of-fit tests

null hypothesis :have a good model

H_A: do not have a good model

```{r}
lapply(
  X=list_glm,
  FUN = function(x){
    deviance_x<-deviance(
      object = x
    )
    df.residual_x<-df.residual(
      object = x
    )
    p.value = pchisq(
      q=deviance_x,
      df = df.residual_x,
      lower.tail = FALSE
    )
    v<-c(
      deviance = deviance_x,
      df = df.residual_x,
      p.value = p.value
    )
    return(v)
  }
)
```
diagnostic plots

```{r}
resid_panel(list_glm[['Age']],plots='all')
```
